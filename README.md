# People Separator
When organising a conference or a camp, everytime there is the problem of splitting people in:
* rooms
* groups for a workshop

This is where my app comes in handy. People connect with there Facebook profile, I get their friends and likes, and using a greedy algorithm I split them _(I didn't know about unsupervised learning algorithms back then)_.

The admin can use the following options for the groups:
* the number of people and the number of groups
* the percent of gender in each group (it is more homogenous to have 50% women and 50% men in a group, but in a room it is a **must** to have 100% of the same gender)

For a demo, I built a website for a fictious conference, **TechFriendCamp.2011**
