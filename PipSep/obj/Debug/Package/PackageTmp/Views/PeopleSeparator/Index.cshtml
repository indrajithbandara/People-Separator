<h2>People Separator</h2>

<p>The "heart" of the website: People Separator will separe your admited students by their Facebook Likes and by their common Facebook Friends (till now).</p>

<p>The first group of people are those who don't have a Facebook Account:</p>
<ul>
	@foreach (var item in ViewBag.NoFacebook)
 {
	 <li>@item</li>
 }
</ul>

<p>The rest of them have Facebook Accounts :-) :</p>
<ul>
@foreach (var item in ViewBag.Facebook)
{
	<li>@item</li>
}
</ul>
